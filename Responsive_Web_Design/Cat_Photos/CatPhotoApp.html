                The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the
                higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place
                lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

                HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with
                Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
                
                Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after
                the p element.

                In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

                A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.

                HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).

                All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. 

                You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.

                A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. 

                In the previous step you turned the words link to cat pictures into a link by placing them between opening and closing anchor (a) tags. You can do the same to words inside of an element, such as a p element.

                Add a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab.

                Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.

                When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.

                <h2>Cat Form</h2>
                <!--The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the
                    browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.
                
                    In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text 
                    field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the 
                    following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.

                    Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example,
                    <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.

                    To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute
                    to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to 
                    the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

                    Use the button element to create a clickable button. For example, <button>Click Here</button> creates a button with the
                    text Click Here.

                    Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. That's because both
                    input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.
                    
                    The button you added will submit the form by default. However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. Add the
                    type attribute with the value submit to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button.

                    label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for
                    assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> makes it so clicking
                    the word cat also selects the corresponding radio button.

                    Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically
                    deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.

                    If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value
                    attributes. Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which
                    is not useful when you have multiple buttons.

                    The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are 
                    block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.

                    The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they
                    should enter into that part of the form.

                    There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label
                    element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute.
